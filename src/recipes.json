      "ingredients": [
        "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
        "2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 teaspoon baking soda",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt",
        "3 tablespoons sugar",
        "2 large eggs, lightly beaten",
        "3 cups buttermilk",
        "3 tablespoon unsalted butter melted, plus 1/2 teaspoon for griddle"
      ],
      "instructions": {
        "stepOne": "Heat griddle to 375. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Add eggs, buttermilk, and 4 tablespoons butter; whisk to combine. Batter should have small to medium lumps. Allow batter to rest for 20-30 mins",
        "stepTwo": "Heat oven to 175, to warm pancakes while cooking. Test griddle by sprinkling a few drops of water on it. If water bounces and spatters off griddle, it is not enough. Using a pastry brush, brush remaining 1/2 teaspoon butter or reserved bacon fat onto griddle. Wipe off excess.",
        "stepThree": "Using a 4-oz ladle, about 1/2 cup, pour batter into pools 2 inches apart. When pancakes buddle on top and are slightly dry around edges, about 2-2 1/2 minutes, flip. Cook until golden on bottom, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter; keep finished pancakes on a heat-proof plate in the oven."
